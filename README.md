# Stock Sentiment Analysis with Reddit 

## Introduction

There has been a gigantic inflow of retail investors after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and FED continuing dovish policies. The market continued a massive bull rally, and stocks gained as if they will never come back. The public's interest in stocks continued, which led r/stocks, a financial subreddit, gain over 11x times its subscribers before the pandemic(460k in Jan 2020, 5.1M in Jan 2023). Active discussion and company analysis happen in the giant financial community. 

This project aims to help retail investors, who might not know the current trend of market, by providing subreddit sentiment analysis like CNN's fear and greed index and comparision between stocks frequently mentioned in the subreddit, the stock's trading volume, and its historical performance . 

As I believe that an individual investor should be responsible for her own investing decisions, the project acts like a tool for investors to assist their research.
